A component diagram is a type of structural diagram used in UML (Unified Modeling Language)
to visualize the organization and relationships of system components.
These diagrams help in breaking down complex systems into manageable components,
showcasing their interdependencies,
and ensuring efficient system design and architecture.

See [PlantUML Component Diagram](https://plantuml.com/en/component-diagram) for more information.
